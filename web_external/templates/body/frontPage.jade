            Image Space is a DARPA Memex application for browsing large image
            collections based on image content (e.g. extracted text from the image,
            image content similarity) or metadata (e.g. EXIF camera identifier,
            image encoding).
        p.
            Type search terms in the search box above and press Enter
            to search the text content of images and image attributes.

            for details. Some examples include:
        ul
            li Basic text search across all fields including text within images: <a href="#search/kitty">kitty</a>
            li Search by IST ad id: <a href="#search/ads_id:4037421">ads_id:4037421</a>

            Use the "Browse or drop image" button to the left to drag-and-drop an
            image or browse your computer for an image to upload.
            All uploaded images appear in the left panel (see Limitations below).

            are stored on the server.

            search results to the left panel. The search in which the saved image
            appeared in is saved to the <b>source_query</b> field in the
            Image details.
        p.
            The links to the left show summary plots within the current search
            results by size and camera serial number,
            and allow you to refine your search by selecting items on the plots.

        h4 Image details
        p.
            The image details window displays all properties of the image
            that have been extracted through the Apache Tika metadata parser.
            These properties vary from image to image, though some, such as
            width and height, are universal. Click the <span class="icon-search"></span>
            button to the right of a property to start a new search for all
            images matching that property value. Click the <span class="icon-plus"></span>
            button to narrow the current search by that property value.
        p.
            Some images contain EXIF data that can link images to other images
            taken with the same camera. For example, in this
            <a href="#search/id%3A%22%2Fdata%2Froxyimages%2F35e9fa60967f700ca3415ea4546fcd81fd1ef779.jpg%22">image</a>,
            click the Details link and find the <b>camera_serial_number</b> tag.
            Clicking the <span class="icon-picture"></span> icon will launch a search
            on stolencamerafinder.com and discover other images taken by the
            same camera.
        p.
            Click "Find similar images" to launch Columbia's DeepSentibank
            image similarity search across all images.
        p.
            The Permalink button brings you to a search for that image alone.
            The URL of this search serves as a permalink to the image.
