        p.
            Image Space is a DARPA Memex application for browsing large image
            collections based on image content (e.g. extracted text from the image,
            image content similarity) or metadata (e.g. EXIF camera identifier,
            image encoding).
        p.
            Return to these instructions
            at any time by clicking the Image Space text in the upper left.

            Type search terms (phone number, email address, etc.) in the search box above and press Enter
            to search the text content of images and image attributes.

        h4 Starting with an image
        p.
            First, ensure you are logged in, or register for an account.
        p.
            Use the "Browse or drop image" button to the left to drag-and-drop an
            image or browse your computer for an image to upload.
            All uploaded images appear in the left panel and will reappear
            on subsequent login.
        p.
            Click the search icon <span class="icon-search"></span> below
            your image on the left to start an image similarity search.
            This will bring your image to the top bar and show other
            options for searching by that image. Some of the following
            options will appear based on attributes of the image.
        ul
            li.
                Click "Content" to launch Columbia's DeepSentibank
                image similarity search across all images.
            li.
                Click "Background" to launch CMU's background similarity
                search. Images are matched on the image background
                (outdoor scene, room decor, etc.) and not on the foreground.
            li.
                Click "Ad" to display images from the same ad.
            li.
                Click "Camera" to display images taken by the same camera.
                This is only available for images with camera serial number
                embedded in the image attributes.
            li.
                Click "Location" to display nearby images. This is only
                available for images with geospatial coordinates embedded
                in the image attributes.
            li.
                Click "Size" to search for images with the same dimensions.
        
        h4 Saving images
        p.
            In addition to uploading new images, you may
            use the <span class="icon-floppy"></span> to save an image from
            search results to the left panel. The search in which the saved image
            appeared in is saved to the <b>source_query</b> field in the
            image details.

        h4 Image details
        p.
            Click the <span class="icon-info"></span> under an image to show
            the image details.
        p.
            The image details window displays all properties of the image
            that have been extracted through the Apache Tika metadata parser.
            These properties vary from image to image, though some, such as
            width and height, are universal. Click the "Search"
            link after the attribute to start a new search for all
            images matching that property value. Click the "Sub-search"
            link to narrow the current search by that property value.
        p.
            Some images contain EXIF data that can link images to other images
            taken with the same camera. For example, in this
            <a href="#search/id%3A%22%2Fdata%2Froxyimages%2F35e9fa60967f700ca3415ea4546fcd81fd1ef779.jpg%22">image</a>,
            click the image to open the image details and find the <b>camera_serial_number</b> attribute.
            Clicking "Search stolencamerafinder.com" will launch a search
            on stolencamerafinder.com to discover other images taken by the
            same camera.

        h4 Advanced
        p.
            You may perform advanced attribute searches directly in Solr/Lucene format, see
            <a href="http://lucene.apache.org/core/4_0_0/queryparser/org/apache/lucene/queryparser/classic/package-summary.html#Overview" target="_blank">Lucene's query syntax</a>
            for details. Some examples include:
        ul
            li Basic text search across all fields including text within images: <a href="#search/hello">hello</a>
            li Search by IST ad id: <a href="#search/ads_id:32711955">ads_id:32711955</a>

            li Search by image size: <a href="#search/tiff_imagewidth:200 AND tiff_imagelength:200">tiff_imagewidth:200 AND tiff_imagelength:200</a>
            li Search by image serial number: <a href="#search/camera_serial_number:3007670">camera_serial_number:3007670</a>
        p.
            The links to the left show summary plots within the current search
            results by size and camera serial number,
            and allow you to refine your search by selecting items on the plots.
        p.
